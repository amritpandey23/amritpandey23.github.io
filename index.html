    <p>Preparing to tackle Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) effectively involves a dual approach, which I categorize as "Mathematics" and "Intuition". Much like mathematics, where one begins with learning theorems and formulas before solving problems, mastering DSA requires a solid foundation in popular data structures and algorithms followed by honing problem-solving intuition.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Mathematics</strong></p>
<p>Start by comprehensively understanding and committing to memory all essential algorithms in DSA. Progress through the following levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Math + Array + String</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hashing (Hashset, HashMap) + Stack + Queue</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graph</strong></li>
<li><strong>Linked List + Binary Tree + BST + AVL + RB</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Acquiring a deep understanding of each topic is paramount. Without ingraining these algorithms into memory, solving problems becomes significantly more challenging. It's akin to knowing what needs to be done but struggling to articulate it. Therefore, prioritize memorizing algorithms for each topic. Here's a breakdown of algorithms for each category:</p>
<p><strong>Math:</strong>
- LCM
- GCD
- Is Prime
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Binary Exponentiation
- Modular Exponentiation
- Karatsuba
- Fermat's little theorem
- Bit arithematic
- Permutation
- Combination</p>
<p><strong>Array:</strong>
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Cycle Sort
- Two Pointer
- Three Pointer</p>
<p><strong>String:</strong>
- All String manipulation methods in programming language of choice.
- Rabin-Karp
- KMP
- Boyre Moore
- Trie
- Levenshtein Distance
- Longest Common Subsequence</p>
<p><strong>Hashing:</strong>
- Hashset
- Hashmaps
- Using arrays as maps</p>
<p><strong>Stacks &amp; Queues:</strong>

- Topological Sorting
- Tarjan's Algorithm
- Kosaraju's Algorithm
- Bipartite Checking
- Articulation Points
- Eulerian Path and Circuit
- Hamiltonian Path and Circuit
- Minimum Cut</p>
<p><strong>Linked List, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, RB Tree:</strong>
- Know-How</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Programming(Classical problems):</strong>
- Fibonacci Series
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Incresing Subsequence
- Knapsack Problem
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Edit Distance
- Coin Change Problem
- Subset Sum Problem
- Partition Equal Subset Sum
- 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- Maximum Subarray Sum
- Rod Cutting Problem
- Coin Row Problem</p>
<p>The list is not complete but you can get exhaustive list of algorithms anywhere on the internet. </p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Intuition</strong></p>
<p>Upon completing each level, immerse yourself in problem-solving. These problems demand more than just applying memorized algorithms; they require a deep understanding of the problem and the ability to adapt standard algorithms to solve specific scenarios. Consider the memorized algorithms as templates that guide your problem-solving approach.</p>
<p>Only tackle problems related to each level after memorizing all relevant algorithms. To access such problems, utilize platforms like LeetCode and filter by tags corresponding to each topic.</p>
<p><strong>One crucial tip:</strong> Avoid fixating on the number of problems solved. While seeing the count rise can be momentarily gratifying, it can also impede progress. Instead, focus on intrinsic motivation and improvement in problem-solving intuition. Think of it as long-term fitness training; it's not about how many drills you perform but how effectively you perform in the actual game.</p>
<p>By adopting this comprehensive approach, you'll not only master DSA but also develop robust problem-solving skills essential for real-world applications. Remember, it's a journey of continual learning and refinement rather than a race to accumulate problem-solving streaks.</p>
<p>That is all one has to do to get good at DSA. Nothing more and nothing less. Getting good at DSA is not essential for doing your job i.e. software engineering but it is a benchmark over which you will be hired and you will hire others. In the beginning of our job we will find ourselves solving DSA problems for getting one and in the latter we will asking DSA questions for giving one.</p>

    <p>Model View Presenter (MVP) is a pivotal software architecture introduced by Taligent Inc. in 1996. Emerging as an enhancement over the then prevalent Smalltalk programming model, which was built upon the foundations laid by the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. In this article, we delve into the essence of MVP, contextualizing its significance by examining the limitations of still popular Model View Controller (MVC) application programming architecture and also developing a simple MVP app to demonstrate how MVP solves some intrinct limitations of MVC.</p>
<p>Some examples and concepts are directly derived from the 1996 paper[1] published by Mike Potel.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/mvp_diagram.png"></p>
<p><em>Fig.1: Model View Presenter</em></p>
<h3>Model View Controller</h3>
<p>The Model View Controller (MVC) framework stands as a widely embraced approach for crafting diverse applications, offering a clear division of the business logic into three key components: Model, View, and Controller.</p>
<p>The Model bears the responsibility of managing and manipulating data alongside relevant operations, ensuring robust data management within the application.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the View component serves the crucial role of presenting this data to users, facilitating an intuitive and engaging user interface.</p>
<p>The Controller acts as the intermediary, adeptly handling requests originating from the View and orchestrating corresponding updates within the Model. Communication follows a unidirectional flow from the View to the Controller and from the Controller to the Model. However, the communication between the View and Model is bidirectional, allowing for seamless synchronization. Consequently, any alterations made in the Model reflect in the View, and vice versa.</p>
<h5>Simple Example of a MVC app</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="images/phone_book_app_mockup.png"></p>
<p>Consider a practical example of an MVC application: a Phone Book app. In this scenario, the model serves as the structural representation of a phone book record, denoted as <code>PhoneRecord</code>, along with collections of such records. Beyond mere representation, the model encompasses standard methods such as <code>getData</code> and <code>setData</code> to facilitate interaction with this data.</p>
<p>The view component, on the other hand, assumes the responsibility of presenting this data to the user, typically in formats such as tabular records. It acts as the interface through which users interact with the application's functionalities.</p>
<p>In the midst of the model and view lies the controller, serving as the intermediary that maps user-generated events, such as mouse clicks or keyboard inputs like hitting the delete button, to corresponding handlers. These handlers, intrinsic to the controller, orchestrate additional operations such as creating new views to solicit user data or extracting data from existing views, culminating in the application of changes to the model.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/mvc_flow_diagram.png"></p>
<h5>Limitations of MVC</h5>
<p>While MVC remains a cornerstone framework for developing applications of diverse natures, it grapples with a significant limitation: tight coupling between the controller and view. The controller often becomes excessively reliant on the view to execute its logic, leading to the inclusion of non-business-related operations within the controller's handler body.</p>
<p>Consider an instance within our application where a "Create new record" button triggers an event. The corresponding controller captures this event, initiates a user interface (UI) to collect data, and applies operations to the model upon user confirmation. Here, the controller's dependence on the view becomes evident as it extracts data, such as first name value, from UI components like <code>firstName.getText()</code>. Following data manipulation, the controller again assumes responsibility for updating the view. This intertwining of view-related logic within the controller epitomizes tight coupling.</p>
<p>To address this issue, it becomes imperative to disentangle view-specific logic from the controller. Tight coupling undermines the modularity and flexibility of the codebase, ultimately impeding scalability and maintainability. By mitigating this dependency, developers can foster cleaner code architecture and enhance the extensibility of the application.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/mvc_flow_diagram_illustration.png"></p>
<h3>Model View Presenter</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="images/mvp_diagram.png"></p>
<p>To address the limitations of the MVC pattern, a separation of concerns between the view, model, and controller becomes imperative. Rather than burdening the controller with tasks beyond request handling, such as event capture and view updates, a more refined approach is warranted. Enter MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture, which introduces the notion of segregating the presenter component from the view, thereby adding layers of abstraction to interact with the model.</p>
<p>The concept of MVP architecture was pioneered by Taligent Inc., a subsidiary of IBM, in 1996 [1]. Its fundamental principle revolves around encapsulating data via selections and commands for the model while abstracting the view logic through interactors. In this paradigm, the controller in MVC retains the role of mapping view-generated data to appropriate commands for consumption. This intermediary layer, known as the presenter, assumes a pivotal role in the MVP architecture.</p>
<p>The presenter in MVP architecture serves atop the view, tasked solely with receiving data from the view and applying business logic by invoking suitable commands or handlers. What distinguishes this approach? Consider the scenario where the view API undergoes modifications in the future. Traditionally, such changes would necessitate adjustments within the controller. However, <mark>by decoupling the view logic from the controller, the presenter remains insulated from underlying alterations, leaving the responsibility of adapting to changes to the view itself. Consequently, modifications are confined to the view layer, sparing the presenter from unnecessary revisions.</mark></p>
<h5>The Presenter of the View</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="images/mvc_mvp_diff.png"></p>
<p>A prominent evolution ushered in by MVP architecture is the abstraction of view logic from the controller, achieved through an additional layer of abstraction over the view. Illustrated in our previous example of the phone book application, the view captures events like clicking on the delete button. Upon event capture, the view gathers pertinent data, such as the ID of the record in the currently selected row, formatting it into a JSON object along with other metadata before passing it to the presenter.</p>
<p>Within the presenter layer, the data is received from the view alongside the interactor object—in our case, the delete button press event. The presenter then leverages this data and interaction event to invoke suitable commands. Upon executing the commands and effecting changes to the model, the model informs the view of the updates, thereby triggering a refresh in the view.</p>
<p>In the MVP architecture, each view possesses its dedicated presenter, offering a tailored approach to handling user interactions. Furthermore, presenters can be reused across multiple views. <mark>By abstracting away the underlying intricacies of the view API and focusing solely on events and data manipulation, MVP architecture ensures that the business logic remains insulated from any alterations made to the view.</mark></p>
<h5>Model</h5>
<p>When developing an MVP application, a critical initial consideration revolves around data. MVP adopts a bottom-up approach, beginning with inquiries regarding data modeling. It systematically addresses questions related to data structures before proceeding to craft suitable presenter logic for data manipulation.</p>
<p>The author of [1] proposes following questions to ask before creating MVP design of the app and it will start with the model.</p>
<p><strong>1. What is my data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. How do I select my data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. How do I operate on my data?</strong></p>
<p>Once a developer has answered this question and enough model related specifications are in place. They move towards asking question related to view.</p>
<p><strong>4. How do I display my data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. What are my events?</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. How do I stich everything together?</strong></p>
<p>Let's build the simple phone book app by asking ourselves these questions.</p>
<h3>Part 1: PhoneBook application via MVP</h3>
<p>To simplify the process of developing an application using the MVP approach, the creators of MVP have proposed a straightforward framework, breaking down the code into the following segments: <code>IModel</code>, <code>ISelection</code>, <code>ICommand</code>, <code>IPresenter</code>, <code>IInteractor</code>, and <code>IView</code>.</p>
<p>In the part 1 of the build, we'll focus on the model and address the first three questions.</p>
<h6><strong>1. What is my data?</strong></h6>
<p>The response to this inquiry can be quite straightforward. For instance, the data may consist of a list of CSV strings stored in a file, or it could represent a database containing phone records with attributes such as first name, last name, and phone number. To abstract the underlying raw data implemention we will first start by creating a runtime representation of this data. Below is an example of a Model for a phone book application.</p>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// getters and setters go here ...</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Additionally, the model is where we can implement data persistence. However, for the sake of simplicity, we have omitted that here.</p>
<h6><strong>2. How do I select my data?</strong></h6>
<p>Now, the question arises: how do we define the data specification? This question guides us in determining how operations are applied to the dataset. For instance, users might want to delete multiple phone records at once. To accommodate this functionality, we abstract the logic of grouping multiple data records from the model. In our example, we support both single and multiple selections of data from our phone book records.</p>
<p>ISelection:</p>

<h6><strong>3. How do I operate on my data?</strong></h6>
<p>By addressing this question, we can develop top-level APIs for our model. To interact with our model, we require commands that execute specific actions. These commands are abstracted in the ICommand component of the MVP architecture. They take the specific selection provided by the user and enact changes within the model. For our use cases, let's introduce two commands: NewCommand, responsible for creating a new record in the model, and DeleteCommand, which handles the deletion of records from the model.</p>

<h3>Part 2: PhoneBook application via MVP</h3>
<p>By delving with the questions in Part 1 we have solved the modelling problem. Now is the time to establish the view and stitch together the functionalities of view with the model with the help of presenter.</p>
<h6><strong>4. How do I display my data?</strong></h6>
<p>For demonstration purposes, we will develop a straightforward command-line application to showcase our data. This view will offer users two options: "New" and "Delete" for respective actions. The presenter, seamlessly integrated within the view, will oversee the execution of business logic.</p>

<h6><strong>5. What are my events?</strong></h6>
<p>Events are user generated entities like button pressed, mouse click, key press etc. Interactors primarily feature in UI-rich applications, where users engage with various event generation capabilities. These interactors are captured by the view. Since we're employing a command-line interface, user requests are manually entered, thus obviating the need for an in-depth discussion of interactors. Here, we'll establish a placeholder for explanatory purposes. </p>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>Based on the above demonstration of application development, the following observations regarding MVP become evident:</p>
<ol>
<li>In a data-intensive environment, ensuring secure and streamlined access to data is paramount. MVP offers a robust abstraction to achieve this.</li>
<li>Unlike the typical MVC architecture where the controller often bears the brunt of handling tasks, in MVP, the presenter simply do what a controller should be doing, which is mapping events to handlers.</li>
<li>Abstracting view API logic from the controller ensures that any future changes in the view won't disrupt the underlying business logic, enhancing maintainability.</li>
<li>Due to its focus on handling data and events, a presenter can be reused across multiple views, promoting code reusability and scalability.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, MVP presents a superior approach and abstraction for application development, providing maintainability.</p>

    <p>I have been reading the history of Linux and Free operating systems since I started using debian in 2014. As a beginner you might be unaware about the story of UNIX and Linux. If you are like me and love linux based free operating systems, you should read this article about the interesting history that took place from 1973 to 1994 in the community that made free operating systems possible.</p>
<p><strong>Before you read</strong>: This article is a super compressed version of the timeline from 1973 to 1994. I may have missed names of many co-creators and contributors who were part of this timeline, this is not by ignorance but my lack of knowledge, please mention important personality in comments if you think they had a crucial role in the development and promotion of free operating systems.</p>
<h3>Creation of UNIX</h3>
<p><img alt="x_86 port of Unix version 7" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1563361035517/8NuKPIYg2.png"></p>
<p>The original version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> was written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly Language</a> but in 1973 it was re-written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language">C Programming language</a> which lays the foundation of UNIX-like operating systems we use today(GNU, MacOS, Ubuntu etc.). The UNIX operating system had a very simple design, working style and was written in C which made it very popular in hacking community and computing business. Over a period of 25 years or so, programmers contributed to the UNIX family to make what it is now. </p>
<p>Today, UNIX is not an Operating System but a specification. The original version which was created and sold by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_labs">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a> has expired. It could have been the most used OS of this era but glip decisions taken by Bell Labs's legal department, prevented its organic growth and promotion.</p>
<p>UNIX was a very expensive product. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_programmer">Jon "Maddog" Hall</a>, who was an early contributor in the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, a single copy of UNIX along with its source code was sold for $150,000. Such high price back then was normal for an OS software in commercial space, but it also meant that individuals could not afford to see or use its source code.</p>
<p>UNIX was a work of art, it invented two new features in the scope of operating systems namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing">time-sharing</a>(multi tasking) and piping. These two features alone changed the way programmers used to write code, for example, with piping it became easy to reuse previously written programs instead of writing them from scratch in new routine.</p>
<h3>BSD: Berkeley Software Destribution</h3>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of 4.4BSDLite" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/4.3_BSD_UWisc_VAX_Emulation_Login.png"></p>
<p>In 1974, Berkley started working on their operating system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a> based on UNIX's source code. It was an academic project at Berkeley University. Ken Thompson, who is the co-creator of UNIX also helped in the release of version 1 of BSD in 1978. Initially BSD focused on creating improved version of UNIX and was meant as an add-on to Unix-v6. </p>
<p>Seeing the success of BSD in academic field, the software was then distributed under the brand name of BSDi or BSD Inc. to distribute copies to people outside universities. Untill version 4.3, BSD used AT&amp;T's UNIX source code which was subjected to properitary licenses. BSDi changed the terms in their license and released a new version named <strong>Networking Release 1 or Net/1</strong> in 1989 which had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD license</a>. But even though this version had BSD license, it still used few components of UNIX propreitary source code. </p>
<p>BSD Developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Bostic">Keith Bostic</a> worked on releasing a non-AT&amp;T version of BSD which had no properitary code and after 18 months of work, <strong>Net/2</strong> was released in June 1991 which set the stage for freely distributable BSD.</p>
<p>After the release of BSD/386 which was based on the port of Net/2, BSDi soon found itself in legal troubles with AT&amp;T. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_Laboratories,_Inc._v._Berkeley_Software_Design,_Inc.">BSDi vs AT&amp;T</a> lawsuit took 2 years and hindered the development. The lawsuit was settled in 1994 largely in Berkely's favour, of 18,000 files in the software only 70 were modified. </p>
<p>BSD released its final version 4.4BSD-Lite in 1995 and was then dissolved. The final versions of BSD led to the creation of various releated Operating systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD etc. <strong>Apple's MacOS and iOS are also based on 4.4BSD and FreeBSD</strong>.</p>
<h3>Minix</h3>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Minix" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Minix3.1.8.PNG"></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lions">John Lions</a> wrote a book to explain UNIX source code. "John Lions' Commentary on UNIX v6" became very popular in universities, and helped students and enthusiasts learn about operating systems. But then AT&amp;T released version 7 UNIX with a clause "You shall not teach". This made impossible for professors and teachers to teach students about UNIX and also document its source code.</p>
<p>In 1987, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_S._Tanenbaum">Andrew S. Tanenbaum</a> wrote a clone of UNIX and called it MINIX(MINi-unIX). It was a fun learning project for Tanenbaum, and also a medium for students to learn operating systems. He also wrote a companion book that explained the source code of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX">MINIX</a>. </p>
<p>MINIX was available to students and professors for free in academic space only. It was not allowed to be used as a commercial software with any kind of liability. Today MINIX is available both for production and educational purposes.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p><img alt="X-Windows desktop running linux" src="https://www.maketecheasier.com/assets/uploads/2016/11/wayland-xorg-xsession.jpg"></p>
<p>Linus Torvalds joined MINIX newsgroup <em>comp.os.minix</em> and started discussing about various <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.os.minix/2Tm_OV64JWo">issues</a> he was having while running MINIX on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x_86</a> computer. To counter the issues posed by MINIX on his computer hardware, he began working on a personal operating system project that he could run on his machine. The development of this project was done on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. </p>
<p>Torvalds posted this on <em>comp.os.minix</em> on 25 August, 1991:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-) 
PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(
— Linus Torvalds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Torvalds' ambition was to create an operating system, he ended up creating a kernel software later known by the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">LINUX</a>, which then became an important component to almost all the incomplete operating systems at that time.</p>
<p>GNU dropped the development of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd">kernel</a> and adopted Linux to create first working <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> operating system and called it "GNU/Linux". Of all the Debian releases, "Debian Linux release" and later "Debian GNU/Linux" became the most popular. Since Linux was free it immediately became default kernel component in all the free operating systems.</p>
<h3>Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate</h3>
<p><img alt="Torvalds and Tanenbaum together" src="https://i0.wp.com/lwn.net/images/conf/lca2007/lt-ast.jpg"></p>
<p>As Linux started gaining attention in the community and academic space, members from MINIX and as well as Linux started moderate debate over the kernel design. Big contributors from both the projects got involved and the arguments became more and more detailed and sophesticated.</p>
<p>On January 1992, Tanenbaum sent a post on <em>comp.os.minix</em> titled "Linux is Obsolete" showering his criticism on monolithic design of Linux kernel. A day later Torvalds reponded to the post by stating <em>he finds the microkernel(which minix have) design to be superior "from a theoretical and aesthetical" point of view</em>.</p>
<p>The debate and passive feud between the kernel communities continued very long. The subject was revisited in 2006 when Tanenbaum wrote an article titled <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/Publications/Papers/computer-2006a.pdf">Can We Make Operating Systems Reliable and Secure?</a>. </p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>After inclusion of GPL license, adoption of linux happened at a grand scale. Today, Linux is used everywhere from NASA's Mars Rover to Tesla's auto pilot system. Linux is backed by major commercial companies like Micrsoft, IBM and VMWare through <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The linux based OS like debian, arch, freebsd, suse etc. that we love today was not made possible just from the contributions of Linux and GNU community. It took genius of Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie to come up with UNIX, hacking culture of BSD to spead and improve it and MINIX to lay foundational development. </p>

    <p>Last week I watched some videos and read article from experts in computer science academia and software industry. I have skimmed some great programming wisdom and aggregated them in this article. </p>
<h3>Program not Code</h3>
<p>On a very basic level the terms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding">coding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">programming</a> can be used interchangeably. But lets just add some philosophy behind their meanings. </p>
<p>When you program, your job is to craftily solve problems, handle errors gracefully, use good component names and document the code. Programming also require programmers to find ways around the limitations of a language or ecosystem and improve them. </p>
<p>When you code, you are simply making things work and getting constantly annoyed by the shortcomings of the language constructs. Coding is a job of applying fixes and patches and disregarding the complexity.</p>
<h3>Big Interfaces make weaker Abstractions</h3>
<p>A class/object with too many methods make program bloated. Multiple methods for variations of same job is unnecessary. For example, when you create a class that converts a given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a> number to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a> etc. you can write methods for every conversion or just one that accept a base value parameter and perform conversion for that base number. In later case, the interface is small but will lead to more implementations(usefulness) and lesser complexity.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="c1">// too many interfaces</span>
<span class="n">convert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toBin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">convert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toHex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">convert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toOct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

<h3>A little copying is better than a dependency</h3>
<p>Programmers move on from their code, its a proven universal fact. When the code base of a dependent package is not maintained regularly it increases the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>. Sometimes our code does not even utilize a dependency completely. A clever move is to always copy some code to make up for the missing functionality instead of adding an extra node in dependency tree.</p>
<h3>Errors are good, treat them like friends</h3>
<p>Learning to program is more about learning to make mistake and then correcting them. A naive move that most of us make is to ignore errors. Generally when program throw errors, we fix them and move on. What should be done is to reinforce the occurrence of errors with helpful messages and documentations. Introduce errors to users as you would introduce a friend to your family. A simple <code>if (err) print(err)</code> should not be the goto practice.</p>
<h3>Use good Component Names and Comment the code</h3>
<p>Naming is the single most underrated thing while programming. Names should describe the purpose of code. A good name can be sufficient to convey if the named entity was an object, variable, function etc. Naming itself can suffice documentation needs for small programs, but description of code in comments will make source code a heaven for future developers.</p>
<h3>Use a style guide for code formatting</h3>
<p>Lets get real, we don't like style guides, but they are awesome because they exist. Programmers talk through their code, and a style guide provides convention. Even if you hate them, you should care about future programmers and implement one.</p>
<h3>Use a suited Programming Language</h3>
<p>A programming language comes with its own ecosystem, which means you can include previously written code in your own, incorporate supported tools and get help from community. Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">turing complete</a> language can solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">solvable</a> computation problems, hence one language can indeed do the job of other. So, it is not a question of <em>what a language can or cannot do, but how hard it can be to implement for a certain job</em>? For example, when it comes to rapid debugging and human-friendly syntax, python wins but at the same time it is not suitable for game programming. Similarly C++ is a powerful OOP language for writing games but hard to use for front end web apps.</p>
<h3>Orders of Ignorance</h3>
<p>Our field is one that requires constant touch with on going research and experiments with latest tools and libraries. We can not only enjoy learning new things everyday but also get rewarded for it.</p>
<p>Learning software development is "knowledge acquisition activity". To acquire knowledge, we should know five orders of Ignorance as proposed by Phillip G. Armour.</p>
<p><strong>0th Order Ignorance</strong> - Lack of Ignorance, I know how to do something and can display by lack of ignorance with some sort of output.</p>
<p><strong>1st Order Ignorance</strong> - Lack of Knowledge, I don't know something but I know that I don't know how to do it and I know what I need to learn in order to be able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Order Ignorance</strong> - Lack of Awareness, I don't know that I don't know something.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Order Ignorance</strong> - Lack of Process, I don't know a suitable efficient way to find out I don't know that I don't know something.</p>
<p><strong>4th Order Ignorance</strong> - Meta Ignorance, I don't know about the five orders of ignorance.</p>
<p>Once we know our orders of ignorance it becomes easy to work on them. For example, while building a software system 2rd and 3rd order of ignorance are most dominant. Knowledge of these orders also convey how serious can it be for us to solve a problem with programming.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This month I started to learn programming(again) by solving Brian Kernighan's C Programming Book, and I have found some alarming deficiency in my programming skills. I have been coding for past two and a half year. I have had always felt that something was missing in way I program. When my code fail I always look for "help" instead of a "solution". At first I used to think maybe I was lacking proper planning skills, but after through introspection I found that the problems were in my habits. I have learnt a lot by these tips. I hope it would be of help to you some day. </p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Running a program without tests is like using a mathematical formula without proof. We “hope” program will work as expected for every input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of converting pseudo code to a working program usually takes one special step at the end called testing. When we write a function we imagine parameters and expected return type. We check whether the function works by running it, if the results produced are as expected, we move on to next function. If something goes wrong we study the results, fix the problem and re-run the function until it yields a correct result.</p>
<p>But this process of manual re-run to check for errors often lead us to miss some cases. For example, function <code>foo(a)</code> gives the expected result but <code>foo(b)</code> does not. We will then fix the code to make <code>foo(b)</code> work but forget to re-run and check <code>foo(a)</code>.</p>
<p>When we run functions we want expected results every time, and thus functions are designed that way, but it is impossible even for programmers to assure the correct output from a function on every execution. To tackle this issue, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation">automated testing</a>.</p>
<p>An automated testing is a procedure where the tests are written separately in addition to the code. These tests are executed to check the expected output of the programs. The outputs of various specs and their test cases are validated with assertions. This way, whenever programmers change the code, they can run automated testing programs to validate results.</p>
<p>In this article we will see how to setup testing in nodejs. I will be using <code>Mocha</code> which is a testing framework for both front-end and back-end javascript. And we will discuss basics of testing by writing some specs and test cases for <a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a> library.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>I have prepared a <a href="https://github.com/ap4gh/testing_with_mocha">github repo</a> containing all the code and test files which are used in this tutorial. You should begin by cloning and installing the dependencies.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git clone https://github.com/ap4gh/testing_with_mocha.git
mv testing_with_mocha
npm install
</pre></div>

<p>Run the tests in terminal with following command.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">npm run test
</pre></div>

<p><img alt="Screenshot 2019-06-12 at 5.43.37 PM.png" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1560341742640/osFyMlS6m.png"></p>
<p>The final version of testing code is in the <code>master</code> branch, however there is a <code>start</code> branch which contains boilerplate setup for you to practice. <code>npm run test</code> script hot reload mocha as you create new tests.</p>
<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>A specification or spec is an entity that describe what a functionality is expected to do in various cases. Example, Let us say we want to test <code>Math.max()</code> function,  we can write a spec in the following manner.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Math.max'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'finds maximum of two numbers'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">===</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">10</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This snippet is entirely one spec and contain three blocks.</p>
<p><strong><code>describe</code></strong> As the name suggests, it describe what functionality we are testing. It takes a <code>String</code> description like 'Math.max' and an anonymous function as parameters.</p>
<p><strong><code>it</code></strong> This block execute the testing code and assert the output. It also takes a <code>String</code> description of the test case and a <code>done</code> callback as parameters. The description of <code>it</code> blocks explains what the test case it about.</p>
<p><strong><code>assert</code></strong> The output of any functionality is validated by comparing it with an expected value. Assert block compares the output and returns a boolean value.</p>
<p><strong><code>done</code></strong> is special callback that tells mocha to conclude a test case. We will discuss more about that later in this tutorial.</p>
<h3>A Simple Test</h3>
<p>All the test files are contained in a directory named <code>test</code> in root of the project directory. Testing frameworks look for this directory and execute every test file in it. In the cloned repo, open <code>test/test1.js</code> file which has following code.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'assert'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'lodash'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Loadash Array Test 1'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">testArray</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">5</span><span class="p">];</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'finds head of the array'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">equal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">head</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">testArray</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">});</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'slice first 2 elements'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">slicedArray</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">take</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">testArray</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">equal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">slicedArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">slicedArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">slicedArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">done</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">});</span>

<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is a very simple test spec, it has one describe block and two test cases. The describe block explains what the spec is about. Describe block also have a variable <code>testArray</code> on which tests are performed.</p>
<p>The first case is about testing <code>_.head</code> method. As intended, this method should return first element in an array. This return value is then compared with the expected value of <code>1</code> in <code>testArray</code> variable. </p>
<p>An assertion is done with <code>assert.equal</code> method. We could also have passed an expression instead of using <code>.equal</code> in assertion block.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">head</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">testArray</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">===</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is the basis of writing tests. We create a <code>describe</code> block to check a functionality and create multiple test cases with <code>it</code> blocks. We can also implement multiple assertions inside <code>it</code> blocks if required.</p>
<h3>Hooks</h3>
<p>Hooks are user defined block of code that run outside the scope of tests. So if we want to execute a block of code that support tests but has nothing to do with the test cases directly we use hooks.</p>
<p>For example, <code>it</code> blocks after performing tests can change the original value of test variable <code>testArray</code>. This will lead to poor testing and incorrect assertions by other cases.</p>
<p>We can use a <code>beforeEach</code> hook that will reset the value of <code>testArray</code> variable before cases are executed. The hooks must be defined in the scope where they are needed. In our case we have defined a hook inside of <code>describe</code> block that will run before each <code>it</code> block.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Lodash String Test 1'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Hooks take an anonymous function as a parameter. In the above code a simple <code>beforeEach</code> is defined inside <code>describe</code> that will reset the value of <code>testStr</code> to <code>hello</code> before <code>it</code> blocks are executed.</p>
<p>Mocha offers three more hooks, <code>afterEach</code>, <code>after</code> and <code>before</code>. After and before hooks runs only one time in the defined scope. If you want to define a hook that will run before or after entire test procedure, you can put them inside a <code>helper</code> file. In the cloned repo you will find a <code>helper.js</code> file containing <code>after</code> and <code>before</code>  hooks.</p>
<h3>Nested Describe</h3>
<p>If a functionality have sub-functionality that could utilize their own spec, you can nest them in parent spec.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Objects Test Specs'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<p>In the above code, spec <em>Lodash Object Test 1</em> is nested inside of <em>Objects Test Specs</em>. The <code>beforeEach</code> hook applies to each <strong>spec</strong> before execution.</p>
<h3>Working with Promises</h3>
<p>Mocha execute tests asynchronously, meaning it will not wait for a case to finish before executing the next. While working with promises the program might need to wait for sometime.</p>
<p>To work with promises, you can utilize <code>done</code> callback. Lets see it with an example.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">assert</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'assert'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>In above code <code>wait</code> promise takes 1 second to return a value. Done is called inside of <code>.then</code> block to tell mocha to conclude the test. <code>done</code> is an important callback that must be passed after each test case is asserted.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Something that I did not explained fully is <code>assert</code> module, it is available directly via <code>node</code>. You can read more about it <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/assert.html">here</a>. If you followed this article you have attained the minimum requirement of knowing how to setup and run test in javascript. Setting up tests in a javascript/node project is easy but your tests are only as good as your assertion logic. If you have any suggestion/query please comment down below or DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/DiaryOfDev">twitter</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go has the benefit of hindsight, and basics are well done: it has a garbage collection, a package system, first class functions, lexical scope, a system call interface and immutable strings in which text are generally encoded in UTF-8. But it has comparatively few features and is unlikely to add more. For instance, it has no implicit numeric conversions, no constructors or destructors, no operator overloading, no default parameter values, no inheritance, no generics, no exceptions, no macros, no function annotations and no thread-local storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Before you read</strong>: This above passage is from the book “The Go Programming Language” by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan. page xiv . The points mentioned below are a brief and somewhat incomplete explanation of terms used in programming language design. I have tried to explain all the concepts from the angle of Go programming. All the points mentioned below are not mine, they are taken from the passage. I am in no way advocating for Go or any other language.</p>
<p>We will now try to understand each term in brief. As a beginner in core programming, having knowledge of these terms are important. The meaning of all these concepts apply in every programming language. These terms can help you distinguish various languages on a fundamental level.</p>
<h3>✅ Things that Go has</h3>
<h4>Garbage Collection</h4>
<p>It is an entity in any programming language that does automatic memory management. To understand garbage collection or memory management, first you need to understand how memory works. While working with a programming language, compiler assign various memory location in the system to store data e.g. creating a variable, looping over an array etc. The allocation and de-allocation of memory needs to be done in order to make program more efficient with memory.</p>
<p>In language like C, memory management is done manually, if you are familiar with C you know there is a function called malloc that dynamically allocate memory in the system. In a high level language like JavaScript or Python, these allocation are done automatically by program known as Garbage Collector. As the name suggest, their job is to manage memory, assign locations when needed and delete memory allocations when not. Go has garbage collection, so programmer do not have to worry about managing memory and space.</p>
<h4>Package System</h4>
<p>Packaging of a software is bundling up of all the source code and assets into one entity called as package. A software package is handy in many ways like easy installation, sharing, contributing, debugging etc. Go has a built in package system that bundle up documentations, binaries and source code files. The purpose of packaging is to be able to use other software projects in your software without having to manually copy over the source code.</p>
<h4>First-class Functions</h4>
<p>A First class function is a function that can be treated like any other variable i.e. it can be assigned, returned, exported, passed as a parameter etc. Take a look at following snippet below written in Go. A function that prints a string hello world first class function is assigned to a variable <code>a</code>. The variable a acts as an actual value in the memory however it can also be called as a function by appending <code>()</code> at the end of it. You can also see that value of variable <code>a</code> is printed just like any other variable. This is a basic concept of first class functions.</p>

<span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w">  </span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="s">"fmt"</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">main</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">  </span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">func</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%T"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Lexical Scope</h4>
<p>Scope in a program is like a block or area over which the definition of any variable/function is defined. For example, a variable declared inside of a function only has its meaning inside that function block i.e. between the curly braces <code>{ }</code>. If you try to access the value of such variable outside this function block, program will not be able to find it. This is a basic way to understand Lexical Scope, it is more of a method of scoping than the scope itself.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kn">package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">main</span>

<span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“</span><span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="err">”</span>

<span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">main</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">            </span><span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// “undefined: v” compilation error</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In the above snippet, there are four scopes. One: the universal scope, two: function <code>main()</code>, three: first block inside function main and four: scope where <code>fmt.Println</code> is called for the first time. Out of three <code>Println</code>, the last one gives a compilation error. This is because the definition of variable <code>v</code> is only available in scope three and four. When <code>Println</code> is called with the <code>v</code> passed in as a parameter, the program first look for its definition in the current scope, when it fails to find it, it moves outwards in parent’s scope and it will keep doing that until it finds the definition of it. This is what lexical scoping does, program start to look for definition of variables and functions from the scope in which they are used/called and move inside out. In the last <code>fmt.Println</code> program is not able to find definition of <code>v</code> in current or any parent scopes hence gives a compilation error.</p>
<h4>System call interface</h4>
<p>Go is provided with system call interface, which serves as the link to system calls made available by the operating system. For example, opening and reading a file, input and output etc. It intercepts function calls in the API and invokes the necessary system call within the operating system.</p>
<h4>Immutable Strings</h4>
<p>Although Go syntax have similarity and simplicity of C, it has an improvement over it with immutable strings that are encoded in UTF-8. So programs written in Go can also utilize forming strings in multiple languages and symbols. In primitive sense strings are combination/array/list of characters in programming languages. As the strings are formed by combining characters, their composition can be changed. Characters can be appended, removed, moved etc. It is a way by which when strings are declared their composition cannot be changed(mutated). The concept of immutable strings are not new, In Python String object instances cannot be mutated, JavaScript too have immutable strings and Ruby added <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/ruby-2-3--working-with-immutable-strings-">Frozen String Literals</a> in 2.3. But still, a great many popular languages like C++, PHP, Perl etc. do not have immutable strings.</p>
<h3>❌ Things that Go does not have</h3>
<h4>Implicit numeric conversion</h4>
<p>In programming type conversion refers to changing of data type of an entity to another. An implicit conversion means that this change takes place automatically by interpreter or compiler. For example, assigning an int value to a variable that was previously assigned to a float value. Such conversion is not available in Go. When the type is not mentioned while declaring a variable, it is assigned a suitable type like int, float, string etc. based on the syntactical composition of the literal. In the example given below, Go will thrown an error because it find two different data types and cannot perform operation on them. This occurs as Go compiler does not implicitly converts int to float64 .</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1.0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// same as float64(1.0)</span>
<span class="nx">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// same as int(1)</span>

<span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%f"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="c1">// invalid operation: a * b (mismatched types float64 and int)</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Constructors and Destructors</h4>
<p>A job of constructors is to head start and initialize an object, whereas destructor is to destroy the object after its life time and free up memory. Unlike other object oriented programming, Go does not have classes. Hence the concept of constructors and destructors does not exist.</p>
<h4>Operator Overloading</h4>
<p>Operator overloading is a way in which the operators can be used to perform operations as defined by users. Operators behave according to the arguments passed. For example in C++ <code>+</code> operator can be used for string concatenation as well as addition of two integers. The meaning of + can also be defined by the user and changed according to program needs. In JavaScript and operation like <code>'1' + 1</code> would result in a string output of <code>"11"</code> due to higher precedence of strings. Such definitions are not allowed in Go, operators work strictly and only perform operations on specific argument data types.</p>
<h4>Default Parameter Values</h4>
<p>Go does not allow default values in function prototypes or function overloading. The Go language specification is remarkably small, and is purposefully maintained that way to keep the parser simple. Unlike other languages where you could pass default/optional parameter values in function, in Go you can only check if value was passed. A different approach to default values in Go will be something like this.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="kd">func</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Concat1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Inheritance</h4>
<p>Since Go does not follow conventional class hierarchy of objected oriented programming, structures in Go are not inherited from one another. In general, inheritance is a procedure in OOP languages in which one class inherits properties and method of its parents’ class. Inheritance can go deep into multiple levels. In Go however, a structure can be composed simply by providing a pointer or embedding to the collaborating structures. An example composition in Go is given below. A replacement to classes can be interfaces in Go. Interfaces do exist in other languages, however Go’s interfaces are satisfied implicitly.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Generic Programming</h4>
<p>Generic programming is a form in which we include templates known as generics which actually are not true source code but it is compiled by the compiler to transform them into source code. Lets try to understand templates in a simple way. Think of templates in programming as a form. We create a form where the crucial details of a template are left blank and is to be filled later during compilation. Then when we need to create something out of that template we just specify the details, for example type.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">MyContainer</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// Container that deals with an arbitrary type T</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// Make MyContainer take just ints.</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">MyContainer</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">intContainer</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In above snippet written in C++. The template is not provided a type, but it is provided one when MyContainer is initialized. We can also specify other types like <code>float</code>, <code>double</code> etc. according to the needs. Generics like templates are useful during running algorithms over set of data having multiple data types.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>An exception indicates a condition which is reasonable and application might want to catch. Through exceptions we can resolve conditions for which program might fail to run. A checked exception does not bring execution to a complete stop, it can be caught and dealt with. Go does not have exceptions, it only has errors as interfaces and built-in errors. A crucial distinction among errors from exceptions are that they indicate a serious problem and which needs to be dealt with immediately, hence programming in Go become stricter. Errors in Go needs to be checked explicitly as they occur.</p>
<h4>Macros</h4>
<p>Macros stand for macro instructions. It is a way of minimizing repetitive task in programming by defining a preset output to a given set of inputs. For example, if we want a square of a number in C we can just do <code>x * x</code> where <code>x</code> is the variable, but we can also define a macro that return square of a number every time we need it. Macros are not functions. Macros are not available in Go.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="cp">#define square(x) ((x) * (x))</span>

<span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">four</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">square</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">// same as 2 * 2</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<h4>Function Annotations</h4>
<p>Annotations are a way of associating metadata to function parameters. In Python annotations are syntactically supported and are totally optional. Lets take a small example to describe what annotation are in Python.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'description'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">prints</span> <span class="mf">6.0</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello '</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'World!'</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">prints</span> <span class="n">Hello</span> <span class="n">World</span><span class="err">!</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In above code, the parameters <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are all annotated with some metadata. <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> are annotated with <code>int</code> and <code>float</code> types whereas <code>b</code> is provided with a string description. foo will print specific output despite the type of arguments mentioned in annotations.</p>
<h4>Thread-local Storage</h4>
<p>Thread-local storage is a computer programming method that uses static or global memory local to a thread. It is a static area where data gets copied for each thread in a program. When multiple thread utilize same static data for same task, they can copy it from TLS rather than storing it on their own.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The creation of Go was focused on simplicity and elegance. It is fast, small and have simple syntax. There are less concepts to wrap your head around unlike other OOP languages. The creators of Go have solved simplicity of a language by not adding multiplicative complexity to adjacent parts of language. Hence Go does not have any feature that makes parser slower and bigger. Simplicity is the key to a good software.</p>
